# How Neural Networks Are Built

## Neurons and Weights
Artificial neurons are simple processing units. Each neuron has **weights** that multiply the inputs. These weighted inputs are summed to form a **linear combination**, often with an **intercept** term.

## Activations and Outputs
After computing the linear combination, the neuron applies an **activation function**:
- **Identity**: outputs the linear combination directly.
- **Step**: outputs 1 if the value is positive, otherwise 0.
- **Sigmoid**: outputs a value between 0 and 1.

## Biological Analogy
Biological neurons send electrical pulses (spikes). Artificial neurons use continuous values (like yodeling vs. Morse code).

## Learning and Adaptation
Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to produce correct outputs. This process is similar to regression and requires significant computing power for large networks.

## Perceptron
The **perceptron** is a basic neuron model with a step activation function. It was one of the first neural network models and is used for binary classification.

## Layers in Neural Networks
Neural networks are composed of:
- **Input Layer**: receives raw data.
- **Hidden Layers**: process data through intermediate neurons.
- **Output Layer**: produces the final prediction.

## Multilayer Perceptron and Backpropagation
The **multilayer perceptron** uses multiple layers. The **backpropagation algorithm** is used to train these networks by adjusting weights based on output errors.

## Simple Classifier Example
A neural network can classify 5x5 pixel images of crosses and circles. Each pixel is an input, and weights are adjusted to distinguish between the shapes. This demonstrates how even simple networks can perform classification tasks.

## Limitations
Simple networks may not perfectly classify complex data. More complex architectures are needed for better performance.
