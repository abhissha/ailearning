# Elements of AI - Course Summary

## Summary

The most important decisions that determine how well our society can adapt to the changes brought by AI aren’t technological. They are political.

Everything that we have learned about AI suggests that the future is bright. We will get new and better services and increased productivity will lead to positive overall outcomes – but only on the condition that we carefully consider the societal implications and ensure that the power of AI is used for the common good.

## What we need to do to ensure a positive outcome

- Avoid algorithmic bias to reduce discrimination.
- Develop AI methods to detect fraud and misinformation.
- Set up regulations to protect privacy.
- Ensure equitable distribution of AI benefits to avoid creating an AI elite.

## The importance of policy

- Regulation of AI must follow democratic principles.
- Everyone should have access to knowledge about technology to critically evaluate expert opinions.
- This course provides the basic background to support rational discussions about AI.

## Our role as individuals

- AI applications affect our lives: self-driving cars, recommendation systems, image and video processing.
- The course aimed to inspire curiosity and continuous learning.
- Encouragement to explore further AI resources and stay informed.
