# Naive Bayes Classification Summary

## Introduction
Naive Bayes classification is a machine learning technique based on Bayes' theorem. It is used to classify objects, such as text documents, into two or more classes. The classifier is trained using labeled training data.

## How It Works
The naive Bayes classifier assumes that feature variables are conditionally independent given the class. This simplification allows the model to compute the probability of a class given a set of observations efficiently.

## Real-World Application: Spam Filters
A common application is spam filtering, where the class variable indicates whether a message is spam or ham (legitimate). Words in the message are treated as feature variables.

### Why "Naive"?
The model assumes that words are chosen independently based on the class, ignoring word order and dependencies. Despite this simplification, the method performs well in practice.

## Estimating Parameters
- **Prior Odds**: Assume 1:1 for spam vs. ham.
- **Word Probabilities**: Estimated from training data by counting word occurrences in spam and ham messages.

### Example Word Counts
| Word         | Spam | Ham  |
|--------------|------|------|
| million      | 156  | 98   |
| dollars      | 29   | 119  |
| adclick      | 51   | 0    |
| conferences  | 0    | 12   |
| Total Words  | 95791| 306438|

### Likelihood Ratios
| Word         | Likelihood Ratio |
|--------------|------------------|
| million      | 5.1              |
| dollars      | 0.8              |
| adclick      | 53.2             |
| conferences  | 0.3              |

## Handling Zero Counts
Zero counts can lead to zero probabilities, which are problematic. A small lower bound (e.g., 1/100000) is used to avoid this issue.

## Conclusion
Naive Bayes is a powerful and practical classification technique. It demonstrates how probabilistic reasoning can handle uncertainty and conflicting evidence effectively.
