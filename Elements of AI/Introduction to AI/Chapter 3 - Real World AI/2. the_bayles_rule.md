<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<li>Definition and importance of the Bayes rule: The Bayes rule is a fundamental formula used to weigh conflicting pieces of evidence in various fields such as medicine, law, and scientific disciplines.</li>
<li>Applications in medicine, law, and scientific disciplines: The Bayes rule is used to combine conflicting evidence and make informed decisions.</li>

<h1>Key Terminology</h1>

<li>Prior and posterior odds: Prior odds refer to the assessment of the odds before obtaining new information, while posterior odds are the updated odds after obtaining new information.</li>
<li>Likelihood ratio: The likelihood ratio is the probability of an observation in case of the event of interest divided by the probability of the observation in case of no event.</li>

<h1>How Odds Change</h1>

<li>Example of predicting rain in Finland: The prior odds for rain are calculated based on historical data, and the likelihood ratio is used to update the odds after observing clouds in the morning.</li>
<li>Explanation of the Bayes rule formula: The formula for converting prior odds into posterior odds is a simple multiplication: posterior odds = likelihood ratio Ã— prior odds.</li>

<h1>Applications of Bayes Rule</h1>

<li>Medical diagnosis example: The Bayes rule is used to calculate the posterior odds for breast cancer given a positive mammograph test result.</li>
<li>Calculation of posterior odds for breast cancer: The likelihood ratio and prior odds are used to determine the updated odds of having breast cancer after a positive test result.</li>

<h1>Base Rate Fallacy</h1>

<li>Explanation of the base rate fallacy: The base rate fallacy occurs when people ignore the base rate of an event and focus on specific evidence, leading to incorrect conclusions.</li>
<li>Importance of using the Bayes rule: The Bayes rule helps avoid the base rate fallacy by combining prior odds and new evidence to make accurate predictions.</li>
