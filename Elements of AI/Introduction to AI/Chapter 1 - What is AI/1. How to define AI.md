# Understanding AI: A Concise Overview

## What is AI?
AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to systems that exhibit **autonomy** (acting without constant human guidance) and **adaptivity** (learning from experience). It’s not magic or sci-fi—it’s math, data, and algorithms.

## Why It's Hard to Define
- **No single definition**: AI means different things to different people.
- **Media and sci-fi**: Blur the lines between reality and fantasy.
- **Misleading terms**: Words like “intelligence” and “understanding” suggest human-like abilities that AI doesn’t possess.

## Key Real-World Applications
1. **Self-Driving Cars**: Navigate and make decisions in real time.
2. **Content Recommendation**: Personalizes what you see online.
3. **Image/Video Processing**: Powers face recognition and deepfakes.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Legacy of Sci-Fi**: Fictional portrayals shape unrealistic expectations.
- **Changing Boundaries**: Once a task becomes routine, it’s often no longer considered AI.
- **Suitcase Words**: Terms like “intelligence” carry many meanings, leading to confusion.

## A More Useful Way to Think About AI
- AI is **narrow**: Great at specific tasks, not general intelligence.
- Avoid saying “an AI”—it’s a field, not a thing.
- Think of AI as a **tool**, not a person.
