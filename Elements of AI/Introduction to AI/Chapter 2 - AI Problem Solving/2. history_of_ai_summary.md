# History of AI: Starting from Search

## Alan Turing's Contributions
- **Alan Turing**: Pioneered the concept of automatic reasoning and intelligence.
- **Turing Machine**: A theoretical model that led to the invention of programmable computers.
- **World War II**: Turing's work on cracking German secret codes.

## John McCarthy and the Definition of AI
- **John McCarthy**: Coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and is known as the Father of AI.
- **Dartmouth Conference (1956)**: Established AI as a field of study.
- **Key Statement**: Intelligence can be precisely described and simulated by machines.

## Role of Games and Search in Early AI Research
- **Games**: Provided a formalized domain for AI research (e.g., checkers, chess, Go).
- **Search and Planning**: Techniques like Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning were developed.
- **Continued Influence**: These early techniques still form the basis for modern game-playing AI.
