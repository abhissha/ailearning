# Search and Problem Solving

## 1. Problem Formulation
Many real-world problems can be approached as **search problems**, where the goal is to find a path from an initial state to a desired goal state. This involves:

- **Choices:** The possible actions available.
- **Consequences:** The outcomes of those actions.
- **Goal:** A clear definition of when the problem is considered solved.

## 2. Real-World Example
Imagine you're in a foreign city trying to get from your hotel to a restaurant using public transport. You use a navigation app to find the best route. This is a classic **search and planning problem**.

## 3. Applications
- Navigation systems
- Self-driving cars
- Game-playing AI (e.g., chess)

## 4. Formalizing the Problem: Key Concepts

### State Space
The **state space** is the set of all possible situations or configurations.

- Example: Locations in a city or valid puzzle configurations.

### Transitions
A **transition** is a direct move from one state to another via a single action.

- Example: Moving from one street to the next.
- A sequence of transitions forms a **path**.

### Costs
**Costs** represent the "expense" of making a transition, which can vary based on:

- Distance
- Time
- Effort

If all transitions are equal, costs can be ignored. Otherwise, they help determine the most efficient path.

## 5. Types of Problems
- **Single-agent search:** In static environments (e.g., route planning).
- **Two-player games:** Competitive scenarios (e.g., chess).

These categories help illustrate core AI problem-solving techniques, even though they donâ€™t cover every real-world scenario.
