## Overview of AI Problem Solving
- **Games as AI Problems**: The section discusses two-player, perfect-information games like tic-tac-toe and chess.
- **Game Trees**: Introduces the concept of game trees, where nodes represent different states of the game.

## Minimizing and Maximizing Value
- **Value Assignment**: Numerical values are assigned to end results (+1 for Max's win, -1 for Min's win, 0 for a draw).
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Describes the Minimax algorithm for optimal game play, where Max aims to maximize the value and Min aims to minimize it.

## Managing Massive Game Trees
- **Challenges**: Discusses the difficulty of traversing large game trees, especially in complex games like chess and Go.
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Introduces heuristic evaluation functions to estimate the likely outcome of the game from a given board position.

## Real-World AI Applications
- **Limitations**: Highlights the limitations of exhaustive search and the need for handling randomness and uncertainty in real-world AI problems.
