# Summary: Regression and Logistic Regression

## Introduction
- Linear regression is a supervised learning method used for numerical predictions.
- Logistic regression is a related method used for classification tasks.

## Classification vs. Regression
- **Classification**: Predicts class labels (e.g., spam/ham).
- **Regression**: Predicts continuous numerical values (e.g., price, distance).

## Linear Regression
- Predicts output as a **linear combination** of input features.
- Example: Shopping bill calculated from quantities and prices of items.

### Key Concepts
- **Coefficients/Weights**: Represent the influence of each input feature.
- **Intercept**: The base value when all inputs are zero.

### Learning Weights
- Given input-output pairs, machine learning finds weights that best match predictions to actual outputs.
- Real-world data includes noise, making perfect predictions difficult.

### Example: Predicting House Prices
| Size(sqft) | Price($1000s) |
|------------|---------------|
| 1000       | 200           |
| 1500       | 250           |
| 2000       | 300           |

we fit a line: **Price = 0.1 X Size + 100**
- **Weight(0.1)**: For every additional square foot, the price increased by $100.
- **Intercept(100)**: A house with 0 sqft would(theoretically) cost $ 100,000
So, for a 1800 sqft house:
  Price = 0.1 X 1800 + 100 = 280
-> Predicted Price: 280,000
- Regression line shows trend and can be used for predictions.

### Interpretability
- Linear regression models are interpretable through their weights.
- Helps understand the impact of each feature.

## Logistic Regression
- Converts linear regression outputs into class labels.
- Predicts probabilities for classification tasks.
- Can handle binary and multi-class classification.

### Applications
- Financial risk prediction
- Medical studies
- Handwritten digit recognition

### Example:
We want to predict whether a student passes an exam based on **hours studied**.

### Dataset:

| Hours Studied (x) | Passed (y) |
|-------------------|------------|
| 1                 | 0          |
| 2                 | 0          |
| 3                 | 0          |
| 4                 | 1          |
| 5                 | 1          |

We fit a logistic regression model:

\[
z = 1.5x - 5 \\
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(1.5x - 5)}}
\]

- **Weight (coefficient)** = 1.5
- **Intercept (bias)** = -5

### Prediction:

If a student studies for 4 hours:

\[
z = 1.5 \cdot 4 - 5 = 1 \\
\sigma(1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-1}} \approx 0.73
\]

So, there's a **73% chance** the student will pass.

## Machine Learning Considerations
- **No perfect method**: All methods aim to extract patterns from data.
- **Factors affecting performance**:
  - Task difficulty
  - Chosen method
  - Amount and quality of training data

## Data Quality
- High-quality, relevant data is essential.
- Biased or limited data can lead to poor generalization.

## Choosing the Right Method
- No one-size-fits-all algorithm.
- Evaluation depends on the specific application and error tolerance.

## Conclusion
- Linear and logistic regression are foundational tools in machine learning.
- They offer simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency for many tasks.
