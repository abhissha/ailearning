# Types of Machine Learning

## Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition, such as using the MNIST dataset, is a classic example used to illustrate machine learning. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits labeled with the correct digit, although some labels may be ambiguous.

### What is MNIST?
MNIST stands for **Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology**. It is a benchmark dataset in machine learning, especially for image classification tasks.

## Why Not Rule-Based Systems?
Earlier AI systems used manually written rules to classify data. For example:
- A loop-shaped pattern might be labeled as 0.
- Two intersecting loops might be labeled as 8.

However, such rule-based systems are laborious to create and often fail due to the variability in real-world data.

## Categories of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model is trained on input-output pairs. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs (e.g., images) to outputs (e.g., labels).

#### Examples:
- Classifying traffic signs from images.
- Predicting apartment prices based on features like size and location.

#### Subtypes:
- **Classification**: Predicting discrete labels (e.g., digit recognition, fake Twitter account detection).
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., price prediction).

#### Important Concepts:
- **Training vs. Test Data**: Always evaluate model performance on unseen test data to avoid overfitting.
- **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data due to being too complex.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the data has no labels. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures.

#### Examples:
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar customers based on shopping behavior.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Visualizing high-dimensional data.
- **Generative Modeling**: Creating new data samples (e.g., GANs generating realistic human faces).

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Used in environments where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving feedback (rewards or penalties) over time.

#### Examples:
- Self-driving cars.
- Game-playing agents.

## Conclusion
Machine learning is broadly categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Each has its own use cases and challenges. Understanding these categories helps in selecting the right approach for a given problem.
