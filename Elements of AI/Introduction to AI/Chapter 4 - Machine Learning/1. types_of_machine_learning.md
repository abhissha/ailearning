# Types of Machine Learning

## Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition, such as using the MNIST dataset, is a classic example used to illustrate machine learning. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits labeled with the correct digit, although some labels may be ambiguous.

### What is MNIST?
MNIST stands for **Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology**. It is a benchmark dataset in machine learning, especially for image classification tasks.

## Why Not Rule-Based Systems?
Earlier AI systems used manually written rules to classify data. For example:
- A loop-shaped pattern might be labeled as 0.
- Two intersecting loops might be labeled as 8.

However, such rule-based systems are laborious to create and often fail due to the variability in real-world data.

## Categories of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model is trained on input-output pairs. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs (e.g., images) to outputs (e.g., labels).

#### Examples:
- Classifying traffic signs from images.
- Predicting apartment prices based on features like size and location.
- Imagine you're teaching a child to recognize apples and oranges. You show them many fruits and tell them which is which. Over time, they learn to identify the fruits on their own. Thatâ€™s supervised learning in action.
- Email spam detection
- Image classification (e.g., identifying cats vs. dogs)
- Sentiment analysis (e.g., positive or negative reviews)
- Medical diagnosis (e.g., predicting disease from symptoms)

#### Subtypes:
Below categories cover the type of outputs the model is trained to predict.
- **Classification**: Predicting discrete labels 
    - Examples
        - Spam vs not Spam
        - Cat vs dog vs bird
        - Disease Diagnosis(eg flu, cold, covid-19)
        - digit recognition
        - fake twitter account detection
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values 
    - Examples
        - Predicting House Prices
        - Estimating Temperature
        - Forecasting Sales Revenue

#### Important Concepts:
- **Training vs. Test Data**: Always evaluate model performance on unseen test data to avoid overfitting.
- **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data due to being too complex.

#### Algorigthms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines(SVM)
- Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the data has no labels. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures. Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined categories or outcomes(labels).

#### Examples:
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar customers based on shopping behavior.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Visualizing high-dimensional data.
- **Generative Modeling**: Creating new data samples (e.g., GANs generating realistic human faces). Learn the underlying distribution of the data so the model can generate new similar data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying data points that don't fit the general pattern.
- **Association Rule Learning**: Find relationships(associations) between variables in large datasets. eg. If a customer buys bread & butter, they are likely to buy jam.

#### Use Cases:
- Image Synthesis
- Text Generation
- Data Augmentation
- Simulation
- Recommendation systems
