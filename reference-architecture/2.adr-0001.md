# ADR-0001: AI Architect Track Scope, Success Metrics, and Reference Architecture

**Status:** Proposed  
**Owner:** Architecture  

---

## Context

AI introduces probabilistic behavior.

Truth does not reside in the model.

Enterprise AI requires:

- Clear boundaries
- Externalized truth
- Auditable workflows
- Measurable outcomes

---

## Decision

Adopt an architecture centered on:

- RAG
- Orchestration
- MCP-based tool integration
- Tool governance and confirmation controls
- Observability-first design
- Measurable SLIs/SLOs

---

## Non-Goals

- Training foundation models
- Using model weights as source-of-record
- Solving all governance in one document

---

## MCP as Enterprise Tool Integration Standard

MCP (Model Context Protocol) will be the standardized mechanism for integrating:

- Internal enterprise systems (CRM, ERP, workflow engines, knowledge bases)
- Customer-owned systems that wish to integrate into AI workflows
- Third-party SaaS services

MCP provides:

- Capability declaration (what tools exist)
- Schema definition (structured inputs/outputs)
- Authentication boundaries
- Scoped access control
- Auditable tool invocation patterns

Architectural implication:

The orchestration layer interacts with tools exclusively via MCP adapters, not direct system coupling.

This enables:

- Decoupled architecture
- Easier governance
- Customer extensibility
- Safer agentic behavior
