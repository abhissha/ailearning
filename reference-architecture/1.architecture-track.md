# 1. Why This Track Exists

Enterprise AI is not “just model selection.”

Most enterprise complexity lives in:

- Data ingestion
- Retrieval architecture
- Security boundaries
- Governance
- Tool access control
- Observability
- Cost management
- Drift monitoring

LLMs generate plausible output — not guaranteed truth.

Therefore, architecture must engineer:

- Grounding
- Guardrails
- Observability
- Measurable operational success

# 2. What “Done” Looks Like

The AI Architect Track produces:

## 2.1 Production-Style RAG System

- Retrieval pipeline
- Evaluation framework
- Citation enforcement
- Observability and metrics
- Cost controls

---

## 2.2 Orchestrated / Agentic Workflow

- Prompt routing
- Tool governance
- Confirmation policies
- Audit logging

---

## 2.3 Architecture Artifacts

- Reference architecture diagrams
- ADR set
- Threat model
- Monitoring runbooks
- Evaluation methodology

---

## 2.4 Repeatable Enterprise Playbook

- Guardrails
- SLAs / SLOs
- Drift monitoring
- Incident response
- Cost governance

---

# 3. Success Metrics

---

## 3.1 Reliability & Performance

- p50 / p95 / p99 latency
- Throughput (RPS/QPS)
- Queue depth(The number of requests currently waiting to be processed) / backlog (Requests that have accumulated because the system cannot process them fast enough)
- Error rate
- Fallback rate
- CPU / GPU utilization
- Memory headroom

---

## 3.2 Groundedness & Quality

- Citation coverage %    
- Retrieval relevance score
- Hallucination rate
- No-answer correctness
# RAG Groundedness & Safety Metrics – Summary Table

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters | How It’s Calculated | Enterprise Target |
|--------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Citation Coverage %** | % of factual responses that include valid citations to retrieved sources | Ensures transparency and auditability; proves answers are grounded | (Responses with citations ÷ Responses with factual claims) × 100 | 90–100% (95%+ regulated) |
| **Retrieval Relevance Score** | How relevant retrieved documents are to the user’s question | RAG quality depends on retrieving correct evidence before generation | Human rating (0–5), Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR, nDCG | ≥ 4/5 human rating or ≥ 80% Precision@5 |
| **Hallucination Rate** | % of responses containing unsupported or fabricated claims | Hallucination is the primary enterprise AI risk | (Hallucinated responses ÷ Total evaluated responses) × 100 | < 5% ( <1% regulated ) |
| **No-Answer Correctness** | % of cases where system correctly refuses or clarifies when evidence is insufficient | Safe failure is critical in enterprise systems | (Correct refusals ÷ Cases that should refuse) × 100 | 85–100% (100% safety-critical) |

# How They Work Together

| Dimension | Primary Metric | Risk if Low |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Transparency | Citation Coverage | No auditability |
| Evidence Quality | Retrieval Relevance | Model guesses |
| Truthfulness | Hallucination Rate | Fabricated claims |
| Safe Failure | No-Answer Correctness | Overconfident wrong answers |

# Architectural Interpretation

High-performing enterprise RAG systems exhibit:

- High citation coverage  
- High retrieval relevance  
- Low hallucination rate  
- High no-answer correctness  

If issues arise:

- Improve retrieval before tuning prompts
- Improve refusal logic before adding more guardrails
- Improve orchestration before switching models

---

## 3.3 Governance & Safety

- Prompt injection block rate
- Tool misuse attempt rate
- Confirmation compliance %
- Full traceability of model + prompt + retrieval snapshot

---

## 3.4 Cost

- Cost per successful response
- Cost per completed workflow
- Cache hit rate
- Token efficiency
